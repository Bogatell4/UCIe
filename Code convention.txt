Nomenclature for sv variables:
terminations: 
_i for inputs, 
_o for outputs,
_r to identify internal registers for other signals (no ned for big memory blocks)
_w for internal wires needed in Logical

Matrix dimensioning order:
Define the convention for defining matrixes from the highest level of abstraction to the lowest. Example:
For a 8 bit 16 element block it will be defined like this: [7:0] matrix [15:0]
if i want to have like 128 blocks of this type of matrix it would be declared like this: [7:0] matrix [127:0] [15:0]
